Complex crises are increasing and in order to ensure vulnerable populations have access to <strong>adapted and high-quality aid<\/strong>, we fervently believe that humanitarians need to be <strong>empowered<\/strong>. Empowered to provide effective, high-quality, discerning, professional and responsible aid.<\/p>\n<p>Behind each and every effective humanitarian intervention there is a trained, qualified professional.<\/p>\n                    <\/div>\n                \n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n\n  <\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"edito-image\">\n    <div class=\"edito-image-wrapper\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.bioforce.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/header-bg.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"container-1440\">\n      <h2><\/h2>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n\n<div class=\"container-1440\">\n\t<div class=\"section-textriche\">\n\t\t<h2 class=\"title-h2\">learn<\/h2>\n\t\t<p>Today, the majority of humanitarian teams comes from crisis zones. National and international organisations\u2019 intervention capacity with vulnerable populations depends on them. Yet these very organisations face the same challenge: how to recruit enough qualified, operational staff. The scale of this problem is such that it can compromise the responsiveness, and over time, the volume of aid provided.<\/p>\n<p>In these areas of crisis, many people are keen to get involved in helping others. So, the problem is not a lack of commitment, rather a lack of training to help these people find employment. The range of operational, professional and certified training which has produced entire generations of humanitarians in Europe, is in short supply and hard to access in these parts of the world.\u00a0 We remain mobilised to nurture a pool of humanitarian workers worldwide by creating the appropriate training.<\/p>\n<p>In parallel, it is important to create the conditions for those already recruited to develop and strengthen their skills throughout their careers in order to improve their practice and evolve within their organisation. For this, each year we gradually increase the number of training sessions in key professional skills in our centres, in<br \/>\nresponse areas but also online. Our partner organisations can now integrate these opportunities in the development policies of their teams.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"text-accroche\">\n    <i class=\"icon-quotes\">\n\n    <\/i>\n    <h3>\n        We empower these men and women who take action throughout the world by making it easier to access tailored, reputed training.
