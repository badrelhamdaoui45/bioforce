There are many crises there, both on a national and regional level, and they have been growing for several years. Bioforce had to be present in this region with the same objective: to professionalise the frontline actors, to make a range of training courses available to as many people as possible and to ensure that the humanitarian action provided by local and international actors is effective, of high quality and sustainable. As in other regions of the world, humanitarian organisations operating in the region face major difficulties in recruiting qualified humanitarian workers, despite the existence of a technically competent national workforce. This has consequences for their ability to work effectively in highly complex operational environments, for the quality of their response, and therefore for the humanitarian impact on beneficiaries.<\/p>\n<p>Bioforce, a major actor in capacity building in the humanitarian sector, had to be there and is going to expand its action, given the significant and growing needs. The many crises in Lebanon today are proof of this.&#8221;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"container-1440\">\n\t<div class=\"section-textriche\">\n\t\t<h2 class=\"title-h2\">For whom are these open courses in Amman, Beirut and Erbil?<\/h2>\n\t\t<p>&#8220;These open training courses target experienced staff and aim to improve the essential humanitarian skills of staff from international, national and local organisations. These short, contextualized training courses are therefore destined for humanitarian workers who wish to develop their skills and improve the performance and quality of the humanitarian response provided, but above all for national and local teams who represent the bulk of frontline workers.<\/p>\n<p>Several short courses are offered to develop key skills of individuals in the region according to identified needs.\u00a0We make sure that our training offer focussing on competencies can respond to different profiles of humanitarians and to different levels of experience, the aim being to enlarge the pool of qualified humanitarian actors present in the region&#8221;.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"container-1440\">\n\t<div class=\"section-textriche\">\n\t\t<h2 class=\"title-h2\">Our Middle East open courses in English<\/h2>\n\t\t<h4><b>Humanitarian Supply Chain Management<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float: left; height: 200px; margin: 15px; width: 200px;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.bioforce.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Plan-de-travail-2-300x300.png\" alt=\"humanitarian supply chain management\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This\u00a0training\u00a0course will cover the role and responsibilities of supply chain in the success of humanitarian program all along the project cycle.
