These changes include ceding more power and control to local responders, ensuring that humanitarian workers and communities are safeguarded, operating with new approaches and technology&#8230; For these to be successful, the humanitarian community needs to ensure there is sufficient professionalism in the sector, and individuals operate with the necessary competencies. Recognising the professional functions that exist and the increasing understanding of the competencies they require will help organisations and individuals to adapt to new challenges and eventually, better answer the needs of vulnerable people. While initiatives seek to give more visibility to professions and careers in humanitarian action (HPass, ELRHA&#8230;), there is currently no holistic, exhaustive and prospective publication on this crucial theme: as an actor in the professionalisation of the humanitarian sector, Bioforce has launched, with the support of the Principality of Monaco, the <strong>first international study on humanitarian professions.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0State of Humanitarian Professions 2020 projectwill give\u00a0<strong>deep insights on today\u2019s state of 24 humanitarian professions and\u00a0what their future will be\u00a0<\/strong>(typical functions within them, characteristics, number of people working in each of them, their typical features, ratio of supply and demand of staff, changes to come, new professions&#8230;). In addition, SoHP 2020 will identify what are the\u00a0<strong>core distinguishable competencies across all humanitarian professions,<\/strong> how they are changing and what they will look like in the future.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"container-1440\">\n\t<div class=\"section-textriche\">\n\t\t<h2 class=\"title-h2\"><\/h2>\n\t\t<p>Bioforce and the SoHP 2020 Advisory Group (Humanity and Inclusion, NRC, ALNAP, CHS-Alliance, PHAP, ICRC, WFP&#8230;) are determined to consult as widely as possible with humanitarian actors: national and international NGOs, United Nations agencies, national agencies, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement; other actors involved in humanitarian crisis management, representatives of humanitarian professionals (PHAP, Bioforce alumni network, etc.), professional networks and clusters, and key actors in professionalisation and learning (training bodies, universities, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>A review of existing data and publications was the starting point for the study. This was followed by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a study based on more than 90 key informants interviews in the 24 professional areas identified;<\/li>\n<li>a survey of active humanitarian practitioners (750 responses);<\/li>\n<li>and to complement the information gathered, 11 workshops around the world (France, Switzerland, Senegal, Sierra Leone, UK, Bangladesh, Uganda, Burkina Faso, USA, Colombia) to ensure that the study captured inputs and insights from the field, from different geographical areas and different types of humanitarian contexts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We will be will be pleased to share and discuss with you the results of this reference study at this online international conference on November 17th.

Traditional practice within the sector has long been based on the idea that the \u201ctraining\u201d of new professionals must be done on the job and in the field.\u00a0Today, humanitarian organisations express a need for trained and competent personnel. They have developed a culture of efficiency and professionalism and look to recruit people who are already trained and operational.\u00a0The mapping\/identification of the various functions\/professions in the sector, their evolution and associated competencies, is essential for measuring the needs in terms of professionalization and relevant training solutions.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The lack of visibility on humanitarian professions and their evolution constitutes a real challenge for employers but also for individuals.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Despite a handful of initiatives aimed at providing more visibility on the various professions and pathways within the humanitarian sector there is no reference that provides a holistic and exhaustive picture of humanitarian professions, their evolution, recruitment criteria and practice, associated training solutions, and professional pathways.<\/p>\n<p>The SOHP 2020 initiative, which is supported by an Advisory Group including the CHS-Alliance, ALNAP, PHAP and a number of implementing organisations in the sector, will provide a sector wide, reference publication on trends in humanitarian professions today.
